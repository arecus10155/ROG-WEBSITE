            For years since its establishment, ASUS aimed to put an ever-greater
            emphasis on PC gaming. This process resulted in the 2006 founding of the Republic of Gamers brand (ROG), <br><br>
            formed for the sole purpose of delivering the most innovative hardcore hardware for truly dedicated gamers.
        <br><br><br><br>From that point forward, the endeavours of the ROG group have prompted 
        a consistent progression of PC gaming innovation that has gotten unbelievable among devotees for its<br><br> exhibition. 
        ROG is something beyond equipment, however – we take a functioning part in the worldwide gaming network,
         building up the business by supporting occasions,<br><br> for example, PAX and Dreamhack. Overall media have perceived ROG as an
          innovator in PC gaming and overclocking execution,
         with huge numbers of our items winning honours<br><br> and increasing positive criticism from equipment stars.<br><br><br><br>
         With this extraordinary reaction from gamers and the business, ROG has all the assets it needs to continue 
         chipping away at empowering far and away superior encounters<br><br> – innovation never rests, nor should the activity!<br><br><br><br></div>

            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
    <div class="textsince">There is a fundamental rule in the industry: in order to produce a successful new product range,
     the designers must have a complete understanding of their consumers. As the R&D engineers <br>at ASUS consist of hardcore hardware fans,
      they are constantly thinking about how they can come up with the products that overclockers and PC gamers really need.
     They set out to design<br> an ultimate motherboard; one with features never before seen by the world.<br><br><br>
    
     At the end of 2004, the award-winning A8N32-SLI motherboard was created, and its success ushered in the next a prototype for future ROG products.
      It was the first motherboard to support<br> NVIDIA SLI dual graphics cards, where the A8N32-SLI Deluxe combined two GeForce 6600 GT graphics cards
       could outperform the ultimate GeForce 6800 Ultra in benchmarks.<br><br><br>

       Its high performance and overclocking margins made the A8N32-SLI Deluxe a top choice among overclockers and enthusiasts throughout 2005, 
       as 3DMark results confirmed, with the top five<br> overclockers worldwide exclusively using it.<br><br><br>

       The Intel based P5N32-SLI Deluxe that came shortly after, marketing the ultimate gaming performance 
       on its packaging for the first time; bringing it one step closer to becoming ROG.<br><br><br>

       However the team of R&D engineers and PC enthusiasts weren’t satisfied with just these two successes;
        they wanted to push the extremes of performance ever further and it had to be<br> something never seen before.
        They wanted to create a society for PC gamers, enthusiasts and overclockers alike, but what should they call themselves?<br><br><br>

        Extreme Team? Too ordinary! Extreme Game Group? Too common! G Group? Not mind-blowing enough! After much discussion, 
        the temporary name “Project G” was decided upon and soon<br> after,
        Project G’s first engineering motherboard, codenamed Pluto, was created.<br><br><br>

        In 2006 after several months of testing the newly established Project G team was officially renamed the Republic of Gamers, 
        and after careful planning 
        and redesigning Pluto, ROG’s first<br> product, Crosshair, made its debut with many new ROG exclusive functions.<br><br><br>


        Very soon after enthusiasts and overclockers got their teeth into it, the highest overclocking frequency record of 3658.3MHz 
        was achieved with an AMD Athlon 64 FX-62 processor. This success<br> threw open the floodgates of records, awards and
        international recognition for all subsequent ROG motherboards to date - and before long – other complementary ROG hardware as well.<br><br><br>

        Since then, the Republic of Gamers has become the brand that enthusiasts have come to 
        demand and throughout its five years of its growth, ROG has thoroughly embraced its brand culture of<br> “The Choice of Champions”.<br><br><br><br>

        The first version of the ROG logo was a cubed letter G, denoting the great depth and many facets of gaming. This morphed into the mask logo, as part of a major brand overhaul in 2008. 
        <br><br>It now includes the new red cloak motif, which debuted together with the Rampage II Extreme motherboard.<br><br><br>
